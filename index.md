### Exodus

I'm learning web developement in order to grow my field of knowledge and experience as a multidisciplinary designer. I have a little background in UX Design which keeps me curious and interested in every web/ mobile developement topic.

### Apocalipsis

At the end of this course/ journey I hope to develope the skilss necessary to detect and solve any kind of problem. My main focus in design has always been creative solutions so this course will only sum the possibilities of solving real life issues using design.
